       "'327  Gregory Kiss et al.  /  Procedia Engineering   118  ( 2015 )  326 – 355 \\n1. Introduction  \\nIn 2008, for the first time in history, human society became primarily urban. For the foreseeable future the \\nw\\norld’s population will continue to move to cities, so that by 2050 almost 70% will be city dwellers. By then the UN \\nprojects the population increasing by 2.3 billion people, to around 9.3 billion. Consequent ly almost all the additional \\npeople will live in cities, either expansions  of existing ones or entirely new ones. This rate of urban growth is hard to \\nconceive: from 2013 until 2050, the world will gain the eq uivalent of 7.2 New York Cities per year (current \\npopulation 8.2 million); one Singapore per month (5.0 million); one Hyderabad each week (1.2 million); a San \\nFrancisco every 5 days (815 thousand); or one Providence, RI (172 thousand) every day.i \\nIn this context, the ecological performance of cities is be co ming an increasingly critical issue. The earth is already \\noverstressed in terms of carbon emissions, fresh water availability, pollution from agriculture, and many other areas. Solving today’s environmental problems will be difficult  enough, requiring technical innovations and significant \\nchanges in behavior. Adding 50% more people will make these problems far more severe. But our unprecedented \\nurban future is an opportunity as well as a problem: if we can make new cities truly sustainable, we can reduce or \\neliminate future environmental burdens. And, the transformation to self -sustaining urbanity may be an opportunity to \\nm \\nake cities better places to live in.  \\nThis is a study of the technical and spatial limits of e nvironmental urbanism, looking to determine how \\nsustainable a city can be. We stipulate that the 2050 City will be completely self -sustaining, receiving all energy \\nin\\nputs and producing all its food and goods within its boundaries – imagine a domed city on another earthlike planet, \\nw\\nhich has to function entirely on solar energy and internal processes. We ask two principa l questions about this city: \\nfirst, what kind of infrastructure does it need to support itself; and second, how big is the infrastructure – and to what \\ndegree can\\n it be integrated into the rest of the city? The answ ers to these questions may define an urban vision that is \\nimpractical or even undesirable in today’s world, but we wish to understand the limits of self -sustainability as a basis \\nf\\nor future planning. Hopefully, this extreme vision of urban performance will inform more nuanced approaches to \\ntomorrow’s develop ment.  \\nWe study two related quantities: resource consumption (e xpress ed in terms of energy); and the size of the \\nrequired urban systems (expressed as land area). Our model is human -centric, based on the activities of the city’s \\nin\\nhabitants (food, travel, consumption of goods), as well as the construction, operation, and maintenance of the \\nphysical city.  \\nEnergy is the principal input into the 2050 City, and is th e firs t unit of our analysis. We measure its consumption \\nfor day -to-day operations, city infrastructure, food production, production of goods, material resources, and internal \\nand extern\\nal transportation. Solar radiation – the most unambiguously sustainable form of energy – is delivered as \\nelectricit\\ny to the city by Photovoltaic (PV) devices. Often envi ronmental performance is measured in terms of carbon \\nemissions. In this study all energy is solar (including th e embodied energy of the PV system), so the project is \\ninherently zero carbon.  \\nOur spatial analysis includes the area of the city itself (the r e latively dense areas within a city’s legal limits, which \\nwe call the Urban Core), as well as the area occupied by the systems serving th e city (the Urban Infrastructure). Of \\ncourse, with unlimited space, any city could be made self -sustaining by using enough land area for solar energy \\ng\\neneration, farming, water collection, and so on. But today this would require a very large amount of land: \\ncontemporary cities have a tributary footprint that is over 50 times as large as the city itself.  \\nThe relationship between these two metrics – energy and space – is not a simple one. It may seem evident that the \\nsustai\\nnable city will simultaneously minimize ene rgy use, resource consumption, and land use – but these goals may \\nat ti\\nmes be in conflict with each other. Environmental impact, food security, water availability, and resiliency are all \\nissues of growing importance, and finding the appropriate balan ce between them will be one of the defining tasks of \\nfuture urbanism.
